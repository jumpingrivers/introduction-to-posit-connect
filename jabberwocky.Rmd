'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\\
\hspace*{1.5em}Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:\\
All mimsy were the borogoves,\\
\hspace*{1.5em}And the mome raths outgrabe.\\

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!\\
\hspace*{1.5em}The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\\
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun\\
\hspace*{1.5em}The frumious Bandersnatch!”\\

He took his vorpal sword in hand;\\
\hspace*{1.5em}Long time the manxome foe he sought—\\
So rested he by the Tumtum tree\\
\hspace*{1.5em}And stood awhile in thought.\\

And, as in uffish thought he stood,\\
\hspace*{1.5em}The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\\
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,\\
\hspace*{1.5em}And burbled as it came!\\

One, two! One, two! And through and through\\
\hspace*{1.5em}The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\\
He left it dead, and with its head\\
\hspace*{1.5em}He went galumphing back.\\

“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?\\
\hspace*{1.5em}Come to my arms, my beamish boy!\\
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”\\
\hspace*{1.5em}He chortled in his joy.\\

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\\
\hspace*{1.5em}Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:\\
All mimsy were the borogoves,\\
\hspace*{1.5em}And the mome raths outgrabe.\\
